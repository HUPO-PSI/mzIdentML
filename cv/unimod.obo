comment: Reduced product of reaction with 3,3-Dithio-bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)propionate. Note that name thioacyl is misleading and subject to change in a future revision. Can also be the product of reaction with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1, 3-dithiopropionate) followed by reduction with DTT.

comment: PET = 2-[4-pyridyl]ethanethiol. This modification is a chemical derivative, based on a alkaline catalysed beta-elimination of phosphoserines and phosphothreonines and subsequent 1,4-addition of 2-[4-pyridine]ethanethiol. These modified serines and threonines produce in MS/MS a characteristic fragment which can be used for precursor-ion-scan experiments.

comment: In a recent publication (see reference), we have shown that family 84 glycoside hydrolases contain a deep pocket beneath the 2-acetamido group of its substrate (N-acetyl-glucosamine). With this strucual feature in mind, we have designed a specific inhibitor that contains a chloride group appended to the end of the propyl chain on a known inhibitor termed propyl-NAG-thiazoline. We have shown kinetically that this molecule is a potent suicide inhibitor of this enzyme famiy and now wish to know the precise residue which is acting as the nucleophile to dispace the choride atom. We have included all residues that are in the vacinity of the chloride atom that could potentially act in a nucleophilic manner.

comment: Carbodiimide mediated blocking of free carboxylic acids (Asp/Glu sidechains and C-termini) with ethanolamine; reaction yields an amide-bond between the carboxylic acid of the peptide/protein and the primary amine of ethanolamine; reaction irreversibly modifies carboxylic acids. Shown above is the composition of the mass adduct, after substraction of water.

comment: Methionine (C5H11NO2S) is substituted in cell culture by Azidohomoalanine (C4H8N4O2). The azido group reacts with an alkyne group attached to a linker (PEO) with a biotin group at the end (C27H45N5O7S). As a result the side chain of Met (C3H7S) is substitued by C29H49N8O7S.
