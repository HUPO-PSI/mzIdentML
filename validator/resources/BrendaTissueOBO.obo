Anatomically, it includes the preoptic area, optic tract, optic chiasm, mammillary bodies, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and neurohypophysis, but for physiological purposes the neurohypophysis is considered a distinct structure. The hypothalamus may be divided into five regions or areas (area hypothalamica rostralis, area hypothalamica dorsalis, area hypothalamica intermedia, area hypothalamica lateralis and area hypothalamica posterior) or into three longitudinal zones (periventricular zone, medial zone, and lateral zone). The hypothalamic nuclei constitute that part of the corticodiencephalic mechanism that activates, controls and integrates the peripheral autonomic mechanisms, endocrine activity, and many somatic functions, e.g., a general regulation of water balance, body temperature, sleep, and food intake, and the development of secondary sex characteristics. The hypothalamus secretes vasopressin and oxytocin, which are stored in the pituitary, as well as many releasing factors (hypophysiotropic hormones), by means of which it exerts control over functions of the adenohypophysis."

Upper and lower gill raker counts may be presented as the upper and the lower (including the central raker), e.g. 9 + 17; or as upper rakers, central raker, and lower rakers, e.g. 9 + 1 + 16. The most anterior and posterior rakers are often small and delicate, easily torn or lost if the arch is removed. Plankton feeders have numerous, crowded, elongate and fine rakers while predators have few, separated, short and stubby rakers."

Enclosed entirely within the tegument cytoplasm of the tubercle are a series of spines, made of actin, which assist in gripping the blood vessel. The tegument is normally closely apposed to the underlying circular muscle layer, and separated from it only by an extracellular matrix of collagen fibres. The tubercle is the exception, where the tegument is lifted up by numerous extensions of parenchymal cells. The parenchymal cell bodies lie below the muscle layers and send out narrow extensions of cytoplasm which insinuate between the muscles to form the packing for the tubercle."

The enteric nervous system innervates the gastrointestinal tract, the pancreas, and the gallbladder. It contains sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. Thus the circuitry can autonomously sense the tension and the chemical environment in the gut and regulate blood vessel tone, motility, secretions, and fluid transport. The system is itself governed by the central nervous system and receives both parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation." [Medical_Dictionary_Online:http\://www.online-medical-dictionary.org/]

def: "The head-foot is the part you see most easily in slugs and snails. It is mostly a muscular organ covered in cilia and rich in mucous cells, which the mollusc uses to move around, it normally tapers to a tail at one end and has a head incorporated in the front. The head includes a mouth, eyes and tentacles, the last two may be much reduced or even absent. In those species with shells the head-foot can be drawn into the shell."

Another location of brain stem cells occurs in the hippocampus, a special structure of the cerebral cortex related to memory function. Stem cells isolated from these areas are able to divide and to give rise to nerve cells and neuron-supporting cell types in culture."

Connecting tubules from several adjacent nephrons merge to form cortical collecting tubules, and these may join to form cortical collecting ducts. Connecting tubules of some juxtamedullary nephrons may arch upward, forming an arcade. The connecting tubule derives from the metanephric blastema, but the rest of the system derives from the ureteric bud. Because of this, some sources group the connecting tubule as part of the nephron, rather than grouping it with the collecting duct system." [Encyclopedia:http\://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/]

Certain forms of apomixis give rise to bulbils, as seen in the lesser bulbous saxifrage (Saxifraga cernua). The term is also applied to various outgrowths formed by lower plants that become detached and develop into new plants. For example, the fern Asplenium bulbiferum produces bulbils on the upper surface of its fronds and Lycopodium selago has bulbils in the axils of the uppermost leaves."

The expanded plasma membrane can accommodate a large number of transport proteins, which are responsible for transporting materials in or out of the cell. Transfer cells are found mainly in salt-secreting glands and in regions where photosynthate (sugar) is loaded or unloaded into sieve elements of phloem."
