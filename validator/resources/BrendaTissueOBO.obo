def: "A cell of an infiltrating (invasive) breast cancer, relatively uncommon, accounting for only 5%-10% of breast tumours in most series. It is often an area of ill-defined thickening in the breast, in contrast to the dominant lump characteristic of ductal carcinoma. It is typically composed of small cells in a linear arrangement with a tendency to grow around ducts and lobules. There is likelihood of axillary nodal involvement with metastasis to meningeal and serosal surfaces." [Online_Medical_Dictionary:http\://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/]

The hypothalamus may be divided into five regions or areas (area hypothalamica rostralis, area hypothalamica dorsalis, area hypothalamica intermedia, area hypothalamica lateralis and area hypothalamica posterior) or into three longitudinal zones (periventricular zone, medial zone, and lateral zone). The hypothalamic nuclei constitute that part of the corticodiencephalic mechanism that activates, controls and integrates the peripheral autonomic mechanisms, endocrine activity, and many somatic functions, e.g., a general regulation of water balance, body temperature, sleep, and food intake, and the development of secondary sex characteristics. The hypothalamus secretes vasopressin and oxytocin, which are stored in the pituitary, as well as many releasing factors (hypophysiotropic hormones), by means of which it exerts control over functions of the adenohypophysis."

Asynchronous muscle is so-named because during oscillation there is no direct correspondence between individual muscle contractions and muscle action potentials, which contrasts with synchronous muscle in which there is a 1:1 correspondence between muscle contractions and muscle action potentials or bursts of action potentials. Asynchronous muscle is only known to occur in insects. The muscles that power flight in dipteran flies, beetles, many of the true bugs and in some, but perhaps not all, bees and wasps are asynchronous muscles, as are the singing muscles of some cicadas."

Upper and lower gill raker counts may be presented as the upper and the lower (including the central raker), e.g. 9 + 17; or as upper rakers, central raker, and lower rakers, e.g. 9 + 1 + 16. The most anterior and posterior rakers are often small and delicate, easily torn or lost if the arch is removed. Plankton feeders have numerous, crowded, elongate and fine rakers while predators have few, separated, short and stubby rakers."

Enclosed entirely within the tegument cytoplasm of the tubercle are a series of spines, made of actin, which assist in gripping the blood vessel. The tegument is normally closely apposed to the underlying circular muscle layer, and separated from it only by an extracellular matrix of collagen fibres. The tubercle is the exception, where the tegument is lifted up by numerous extensions of parenchymal cells. The parenchymal cell bodies lie below the muscle layers and send out narrow extensions of cytoplasm which insinuate between the muscles to form the packing for the tubercle."

def: "Cells used by rays, electric eels and other electric fish for electrogenesis and electroreception. They are flat disk-like cells that are stacked in a sequence in a manner similar to a battery. Electric eels have several thousand of these cells stacked, each producing 0.15V. The cells function by pumping positive sodium and potassium ions out of the cell via transport proteins powered by adenosine triphosphate. Postsynaptically, electrocytes work much like muscle cells. They have nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These cells are used in research because of their resemblance to nerve-muscle junctions. Location: In the electric ray Torpedo, electroplax are found near the pectoral muscles and the gills. In all other fishes, it is often near the tail. In one fish genus, the Malaptaturus, the electric organs are not made of individual electroplax, but are built up from charges of the epithelium, specifically the skin."

Another location of brain stem cells occurs in the hippocampus, a special structure of the cerebral cortex related to memory function.

Another location of brain stem cells occurs in the hippocampus, a special structure of the cerebral cortex related to memory function. Stem cells isolated from these areas are able to divide and to give rise to nerve cells and neuron-supporting cell types in culture."

Connecting tubules from several adjacent nephrons merge to form cortical collecting tubules, and these may join to form cortical collecting ducts. Connecting tubules of some juxtamedullary nephrons may arch upward, forming an arcade. The connecting tubule derives from the metanephric blastema, but the rest of the system derives from the ureteric bud. Because of this, some sources group the connecting tubule as part of the nephron, rather than grouping it with the collecting duct system." [Encyclopedia:http\://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/]

It receives axonal input from the vomeronasal organ, a distinct sensory epithelium from the main olfactory epithelium that detects pheromones, among other chemical stimuli. Like the main olfactory bulb, axonal input to the accessory olfactory bulb forms synapses with mitral cells within glomeruli. However, mitral cells in the accessory olfactory bulb project their axons to targets in the amygdala and hypothalamus where they may influence aggressive and mating behavior."

def: "The juxtaglomerular apparatus is a microscopic structure in the kidney, which regulates the function of each nephron. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named for its proximity to the glomerulus. It is found between the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle and the returning distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron. This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. The three cellular components of the apparatus are the macula densa, extraglomerular mesangial cells, and juxtaglomerular cells." [Wikipedia:The_Free_Encyclopedia]

Certain forms of apomixis give rise to bulbils, as seen in the lesser bulbous saxifrage (Saxifraga cernua). The term is also applied to various outgrowths formed by lower plants that become detached and develop into new plants. For example, the fern Asplenium bulbiferum produces bulbils on the upper surface of its fronds and Lycopodium selago has bulbils in the axils of the uppermost leaves."

CIN is not cancer, and is usually curable. Most cases of CIN remain stable, or are eliminated by the host's immune system without intervention. However a small percentage of cases progress to become cervical cancer, usually cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), if left untreated." [Wikipedia:The_Free_Encyclopedia]

def: "Neuropil is a broad term defined as any area in the nervous system composed of mostly unmyelinated axons, dendrites and glial cell processes that forms a synaptically dense region containing a relatively low number of cell bodies. The most prevalent anatomical region of neuropil is the brain which, although not completely composed of neuropil, does have the largest and highest synaptically-concentrated areas of neuropil in the body. White matter, which is mostly composed of axons and glial cells, is generally not considered to be a part of the neuropil." [Wikipedia:The_Free_Encyclopedia]

def: "Chrysene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with the molecular formula C18H12 that consists of four fused benzene rings. It is a natural constituent of coal tar, from which it was first isolated and characterized. It is also found in creosote, a chemical used to preserve wood. As with other PAHs, chrysene is suspected to be a human carcinogen. It is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals." [Wikipedia:The_Free_Encyclopedia]

The cells in the quiescent centre are capable of assuming meristematic activity if the initials in the meristem are damaged, and thus act as a reservoir of potential initials, protected from damage by their relative inactivity. The quiescent centre may also be a site of auxin synthesis." [Dictionary_of_Botany:http\://botanydictionary.org/]

def: "A type of plant cell specialized for the short-distance high-volume transport of materials. Transfer cells have numerous knobs and ridges on the inner surface of the primary cell wall. These greatly increase the surface area of the plasma membrane, which follows the contours of the protuberances. The expanded plasma membrane can accommodate a large number of transport proteins, which are responsible for transporting materials in or out of the cell. Transfer cells are found mainly in salt-secreting glands and in regions where photosynthate (sugar) is loaded or unloaded into sieve elements of phloem."
